# logA
This repository doesn't contain any code, it's just a bug tracker for logA - a logger GUI for Android.

logA is a logcat front-end for Windows that is bloat-free and easy to use.

## Download & Installation
Download the app from itch.io. Once downloaded, extract the zip file and launch the executable. If your Android SDK is in a _not so easy to guess_-location, please read the README.txt included in the package to learn how to convey that information to the tool.

## But I have a bug / feature request!
Just make a ticket right here! Go to _Issues_ and let us know!

## Ok so... how do I support this project?
Go to [itch.io](https://gameloom-studio.itch.io/loga) and download it. If you like to share your experience make a comment / rating there, and if you really want to you can specify a sum to pay when you download.
